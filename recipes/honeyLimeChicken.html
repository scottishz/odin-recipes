            </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make marinade: Whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, lime juice, honey, garlic, McCormick Ground Tumeric, and McCormick Ground Ginger. </li>
                <li>Add chicken and toss to evenly coat with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°. In a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat, heat enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Season both sides of marinated chicken with salt</li>
                <li>Add chicken to pan skin-side down. Sear until skin becomes golden and crispy, about 6 minutes. Flip chicken thighs, and cook 2 minutes more. Turn off the heat, pour in remaining marinade, and transfer pan into hot oven. </li>
                <li>Bake until chicken is cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Serve with white rice and drizzle with extra pan drippings.</li>
