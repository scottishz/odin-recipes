        <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare Fish: Pat the fish dry with paper towels and season with 1/4 tsp. salt. Place fish in a small baking dish (8x8" or 9x9") or wide-rimmed bowl. In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp. olive oil, orange juice, and taco seasoning; whisk to combine. Pour mixture over fish and gently turn fish to coat in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. </li>
                <li>Prepare Mango Salsa: In a large bowl, combine mango, red bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, jalape√±o, lime juice, cumin, and salt; mix to combine. Refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
                <li>Prepare Baja Sauce and Slaw: In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt (or sour cream), mayonnaise, lime juice, Old Bay Seasoning, and a dash of hot sauce (if using); whisk to combine.</li>
                <li>In a separate large bowl, add shredded cabbage (or coleslaw) and season with a pinch of salt. Add 3 Tbsp. of the Baja Sauce and reserve remaining for topping. Toss slaw to combine and set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook the Fish: Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add the marinated fish and cook, undisturbed, for about 4 minutes. Gently flip, and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the fish is firm to the touch. Transfer fish to a plate and flake into large chunks</li>
                <li>Assemble Tacos: Place a small amount of slaw in each tortilla, followed by the fish, mango salsa, and a finishing drizzle of remaining Baja Sauce. </li>
            </ol>
